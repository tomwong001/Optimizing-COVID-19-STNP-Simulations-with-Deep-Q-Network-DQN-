# Optimizing-COVID-19-STNP-Simulations-with-Deep-Q-Network-DQN-
In this capstone project, supervised by Professor Rose Yu and Professor Yian Ma at UCSD, our team of three members designed and implemented a Deep-Q Network (DQN) using PyTorch to optimize COVID-19 STNP simulations. Our approach resulted in a 30% reduction in exploration time of parameter space compared to traditional brute-force search methods. Key enhancements included:

* Adjusting learning rate and buffer size.
* Implementing action prioritization.
* Normalizing state and reward values.
* Experimenting with various model architectures and hyperparameters.

Through these improvements, we further optimized the deep reinforcement learning method, showcasing its potential for practical application in managing COVID-19 transmission.
